//To find the intersection of two linked lists, I used a two-pointer approach. 
//I initialized two pointers at the heads of the two lists and traversed through them. 
//When each pointer reached the end of a list, 
//I redirected it to the head of the other list. 
//If the lists intersect, the pointers eventually met at the intersection node. 
//If they didnâ€™t intersect, both pointers reached the end (null) simultaneously. 
//This approach ensured that both pointers traveled the same total distance, 
//thus meeting at the intersection or end at the same time.

//Time: n+m
//Space: constant
