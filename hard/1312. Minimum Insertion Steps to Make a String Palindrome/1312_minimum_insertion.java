//I used a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. 
//I initialized a 2D array `dp` to store intermediate results and 
//converted the string `s` into a character array. 
//I defined a helper function that took the character array, starting index, ending index, and the `dp` array. 
//The function checked if the characters at the start and end were the same, 
//incrementing pointers inward if they matched. 
//If not, it calculated the minimum insertions by 
//recursively trying both possibilitiesâ€”inserting at the start or at the end. 
//The result was stored in the `dp` array to avoid redundant calculations.

//Time: O(n^2)
//Space: O(n^2)
