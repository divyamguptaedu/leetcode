#### Action Plan:
| Problem No. | Name | Approach | Stated Difficulty | Personal Difficulty |
| ----------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| __[53](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)__ | Maximum SubArray | Interated over the array to find a new maximum sum and update the old if required. | Easy | Medium |
| __[70](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)__ | Climbing Stairs | Used recursion from the top of the stairs with a base case of 1 and 2 steps left. | Easy | Medium |
| __[104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)__ | Maximum Depth of Binary Tree | Used recursion to go down the tree from both side simultaneously and choose the new maximum depth. | Easy | Easy |
| __[108](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)__ | Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree | Used binary search approach to choose a new middle everytime and add to the BST. | Easy | Easy |
| __[160](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)__ | Intersection of Two Linked Lists | Utilized the efficiency of hashmap data structure to find an already visited node. | Easy | Easy |
| __[169](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)__ | Majority Element | Utilized the efficiency of hashmap data structure to track the frequency of each distinct integer in the array and return when condition is fulfilled. | Easy | Easy |
| __[234](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)__ | Palindrome Linked List | Converting the LinkedList to an array and using the pointer approach to check the pattern. | Easy | Medium |
| __[283](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)__ | Move Zeroes | Used simple approach to interate over the array and move the every zero to the end without making any copy of the array. | Easy | Easy |
| __[448](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)__ | Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array | Used a hashmap to find the integers not present in the array. | Easy | Easy |
| __[543](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)__ | Diameter of Binary Tree | Used recursion to calculate maximum depth from each node and update the new maximum. | Easy | Medium |
| __[617](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)__ | Merge Two Binary Trees | Used recursion to update the first tree based on the data found in the second tree. | Easy | Easy |
| __[46](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)__ | Permutations | <strong>Initial Approach:</strong> Used recursion to freeze one element of the array and swap others in all possible ways. <br /> <strong>Better Approach:</strong> Used recursion to remove each element from the holder and add to each possible permutation answer.  | Medium | Hard |
| __[763](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)__ | Partition Labels | Used hashmap to track the last index of each element and update start/end based on elements found in between. | Medium | Medium |
