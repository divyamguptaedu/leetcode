//To find the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock, I calculated the angles for each hand separately. The minute hand's angle was derived by multiplying the minutes by 6 (since each minute represents 6 degrees). The hour hand's angle was computed by considering both the hour and the minutes (since each hour represents 30 degrees, and each minute contributes to the hour hand's position). I then calculated the absolute difference between these angles and returned the smaller of this difference or its complement to 360 degrees.
//Time: O(1)
//Space: O(1)
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        // Each minute represents 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes)
        int oneMinAngle = 6;
        // Each hour represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours)
        int oneHourAngle = 30;
        // Calculate the angle of the minute hand
        double minutesAngle = oneMinAngle * minutes;
        // Calculate the angle of the hour hand, considering the fractional movement by the minute hand
        double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * oneHourAngle;

        // Calculate the absolute difference between the two angles
        double diff = Math.abs(hourAngle - minutesAngle);
        // Return the smaller angle between the calculated difference and its complement to 360 degrees
        return Math.min(diff, 360 - diff);
    }
