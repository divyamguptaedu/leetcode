//I used a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to update the distances of empty rooms
//to the nearest gate. First, I added all gates to a queue.
//Then, I processed each gate by exploring its neighboring cells in four directions.
//If a neighboring cell was an empty room, 
//I updated its distance to be one more than the current cellâ€™s distance and added
//it to the queue. This ensured that all empty rooms were filled with the shortest
//distance to the nearest gate by expanding layer by layer from each gate.

//Space: mn
