//I approached the Game of Life problem by iterating through each cell in the
//board and applying the rules simultaneously to determine the next state of 
//each cell based on its neighbors. Using a neighbors array, 
//I checked all eight possible neighbors for each cell, counting live neighbors. 
//Depending on the current state of the cell and the count of live neighbors, 
//I updated the cell's state accordingly: marking live cells to die (-1) or 
//marking dead cells to become alive (2). After computing the next state 
//for all cells, I finalized the board by converting temporary states (-1 and 2) 
//back to 0 and 1, respectively.

//Time: MN
//Space: constant
