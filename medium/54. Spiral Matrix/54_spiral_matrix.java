//To solve the problem of traversing a matrix in spiral order, 
//I used a directional approach. I defined four possible movement directions 
//(right, down, left, up) and tracked the current direction. 
//I started at the top-left corner of the matrix and marked visited 
//elements with a special value. While traversing, 
//I kept changing the direction when hitting the matrix boundaries or a 
//previously visited cell. I repeated this process until 
//I covered all the elements in the matrix.

//Time: MN
//Space: constant
