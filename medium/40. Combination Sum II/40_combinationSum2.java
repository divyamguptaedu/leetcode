//I sorted the input array to handle duplicates. I used backtracking to build combinations, 
//starting from each index and adding numbers to the current combination. 
//To avoid duplicate combinations, I skipped numbers that were the same as the previous number in the array unless 
//it was the first instance of that number at the current level of recursion. 
//If the current combinationâ€™s sum exceeded the target, I stopped exploring further. 
//Once the sum equaled the target, I added the current combination to the results list. 
//Each number in candidates was used at most once in each combination.

//Time: O(2^n) where n is the size of the input array. 
//In worst case our algo will use all possible combinations from the input array, which total will be 2^n combinations. 
//Sorting will take n log n. 2^n dominates.
//Space: O(n)
