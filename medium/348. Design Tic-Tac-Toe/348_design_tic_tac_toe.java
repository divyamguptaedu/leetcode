//I used an array-based approach to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game on an n x n board. 
//I tracked the count of each player's marks in rows, columns, and both diagonals. 
//Each playerâ€™s move updated these counts, adding 1 for player 1 and -1 for player 2. 
//After each move, I checked if any count reached the absolute value of n, indicating a win. 
//If a win condition was met in any row, column, or diagonal, the player won. 
//Otherwise, the game continued.

//Time: O(1)
//Space: O(n)
